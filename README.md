## Introduction to WEkEO Notebooks


#### CMEMS Reanalysis: Seasonal and Annual Trends of the Sea Surface Temperature in the Adriatic Sea.
The Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is an important physical characteristic of the oceans. The Adriatic Sea is an elongated basin, located in the central Mediterranean, between the Italian peninsula and the Balkans.The CMEMS Mediterranean Sea Physics Reanalysis time series is provided from 01/01/1987 to 31/12/2019. The SST is defined by selecting the first vertical level of the daily mean of Potential Temperature within the variable name “thetao” and downloaded from https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/product-download/MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_006_004  

#### Accordingly, the input “CMEMS_SST” in the netCDF format is prepared to display Seasonal and Annual Maps together with Trends. The Spatial data for the Area of Interest is called “areaAdriatic” in the CSV format. 
The Input Data “CMEMS_SST.nc” and “areaAdriatic.csv” are present in the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1D1kQBpmnS4r2Dhq7f8bkhWXC_WF8gIkD 
The Sections of the Notebooks:
1)	[WEkEO_Part_1](https://github.com/007-Ozalp/WEkEO/tree/main/WEkEO_PART_1_Aggregations): Functions of the Data Aggregation for the Winter, Summer Period selection and Annual Mean MapS.
2)	WEkEO_Part_2: Map and plot visualizations of aggregated data with functions.
